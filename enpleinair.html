    <p>In 2012 and 2013 artist Rick Silva took his laptop into remote locations throughout the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains to create each of these works in one sitting reacting to the immediate terrain and conditions. While software and simulation claim to have reduced landscape to a sequence of topographical polygons, Silva aims to break these chains apart in order to tap into the hidden possibilities of these defaults. My own take on this was to re-image skateboarding spots I photographed around the city. Hover over my images to see how Rick Silva re-imagined landscapes.</p>
